<p>
All of our adoptable dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on required vaccines, heartworm tested (if old enough), current on flea/tick & heartworm prevention, dewormed,
 and microchipped. The adoption donation also helps offset the costs associated with transport to New England, state mandated quarantine, and health certificates.  
   
Note: Our adoption fee only barely covers the cost for a healthy dog; many of our dogs have pre-existing medical conditions such as heartworm which cost hundreds more.

Adoptable Dogs!

        Hi I'm Rozzie! I am an energetic and lovable Dobie. I've had a good amount of training and know several commands. I love walking on the leash and I listen very well! I
    love my people and like to be with my family, but I do take some time to warm up to strangers on my own territory. I'm very loyal to my family, especially the toddlers 
    in my house, so I feel the need to go on guard when someone unknown is approaching them. I show my guarding tendencies with hackles and a scary sounding bark. However,
    I'm very smart and can be redirected. Once I know someone is not a threat, I let my guard down.
    
    I love to eat...snacks are the best motivator for me. I get a little anxious when meeting strange dogs on a leashed walk, but once introduced properly I get along great
    with familiar dogs. I do go to doggie daycare regularly where I love to romp around with all my K9 friends. I cannot wait to meet my new family!
